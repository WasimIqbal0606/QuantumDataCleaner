Advanced Hybrid OCR + Quantum Time-Series Data Cleaning System — Replit Deployment Version
Prompt Purpose
Expand the hybrid time-series data cleaning system by injecting OCR-based data extraction and Quantum-enhanced preprocessing, fully modular, real-time, and ready to run inside Replit's environment using lightweight tunneling (e.g., ngrok or Cloudflared).

Target a high-performance, low-dependency conflict, full-stack system combining:

Optical Character Recognition (OCR) pipelines

Quantum noise reduction and anomaly preprocessing

Deep Learning models

Bandit-based optimization

FastAPI + Streamlit bi-directional live UX

Colab and Replit simultaneous support

Full Architecture Upgrade Details

Layer	New Components
OCR Layer	Tesseract-OCR (easy install) or Hugging Face LayoutLM for advanced extraction
Quantum Layer	PennyLane + Qiskit CPU simulators for lightweight quantum operations (denoising, feature extraction)
Classical Cleaning	pandas, statsmodels, scipy, Prophet
Deep Learning Cleaner	Hugging Face Informer or TimeSeriesTransformer fine-tuned
Bandit Selector	Vowpal Wabbit / Scikit-Optimize contextual multi-armed bandits
Frontend	Streamlit with TailwindCSS, Chart.js, FontAwesome icons, st.file_uploader, st.download_button
Backend	FastAPI with WebSocket real-time communication, BackgroundTasks for async OCR + cleaning jobs
Hosting/Access	Replit container, Tunneling via ngrok/Cloudflared, optional Firebase frontend proxy
Workflow Pipeline
User Uploads File or Live Data (CSV, Image, PDF)

OCR Module Activated (for images/pdf) → Text/Tabular extraction

Quantum Noise Reduction Layer → (Simulated on CPU via PennyLane)

Bandit Engine decides → Which cleaning pipeline to run

Classical + Deep Cleaning → Fix missing data, anomalies

Streaming Live Updates → Streamlit frontend charts update in real-time

User Downloads cleaned + annotated data
